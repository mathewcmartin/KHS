# Seaplane Base Plan Rejected

> The board of county commissioners yesterday disposed of a "hot potato" when they unanimously denied all applications for seaplane bases on Lake Washington and Lake Sammamish.
Proposed bases affected included sites at Newport, Kenmore and on Lake Sammamish--all of which had been opposed strenuously by residents of the areas.
The matter probably will come before the commissioners later when the aviation advisory committee of the county planning commission makes its report overall plans for the spotting of airports and seaplanes bases throughout King County.
A $7,600 emergency appropriation, requested by Coroner John P. Brill Jr. for extra help because of an "enormous increase in work" in the coroner's office, was granted by the commissioners.
Alarmed at the heavy toll of traffic accidents in King County, Commissioner Archie E. Phelps moved that County Engineer Conrad O. Mannes be delegated to make a survey of traffic conditions to find if the motorist of the condition of county roads is primarily at fault for the heavy increase.
Phelps proposed that a traffic expert be employed to make recommendations, cost of the survey to be borne by both county road districts. Phelps motion carried.
