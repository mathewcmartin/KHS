In 30 years, the Kenmore Air Harbor has grown from modest beginnings to become the country's largest facility for outfitting, maintaining and mooring seaplanes.

Bob Munro and Jack Mines established the air harbor in 1946 with a single hanger and airplane, near a swamp at the north end of Lake Washington.

Today, there are 14 planes and 12 pilots. The air harbor is also home base for 70 to 80 seaplanes owned by residents of Puget Sound.

The company's pilots and planes take off from the water in front of the air harbor to perform their regular services -- shuttling well heeled commutors between Seattle jobs and San Juan Island homes, making aerial inspections for government agencies, and coming to the assistance of other seaplane pilots and vessels stranded on northwest waters.

Recently, however, the air harbor has been picking up some of the slack caused by shortages of seaplanes and pilots in parts of Alaska.

The air harbor has always done a brisk trade with the 49th state. Alaska has areas stretching for hundreds of miles where seaplanes are the the best, if not the only, mode of transportation for residents and sportsmen alike.

But lately, mechanics and instructors at the air harbor have been processing planes and pilots involved in the activity of the Aleyeska oil pipeline.

The air harbor recently acquired 10 large DeHavilland (sic) Beavers that are pressently being equipped with pontoons and readied for Alaskan customers.

In fact, most of the planes headed for Alaskan markets are re-equipped at the air harbor. Mechanics go through nearly 100 new pairs of floats each year, turning regular airplanes into seaplanes.

Some of the pilots who'll be flying those planes are also receiving training at the air harbor, one of the few places in the country where pilots can be trained to fly float planes.

Lake Washington serves as a natural runway for the training sessions.

Munro, a partner in the corporation which now owns the air harbor, also has some personal ties to the nation's largest state. After graduating from high school, he worked for a while in a commercial gold mine in Alaska.

Since that time, he's build the Kenmore seaplane facility into the largest in the country.

In fact, Munro contends Puget Sound is not only the pleasure boating capital, but also the seaplane capital fo the world now.
