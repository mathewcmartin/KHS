Body Text:
> From a one-plane, one-drum of Mobilegas beginning two years ago to an operation currently basing 20 planes--- that's what happened at the Kenmore Air Harbor at Kenmore Wash.

> Built along the shore of a cove at the northern end of Lake Washington, the Kenmore Air Harbor, Inc,, is exclusively a water operation. Bob Munro is the installations manager in addition to being president of the corporation. Five of the 20 planes based at Kenmore are the property of the company and 15 are privately owned. Ten of the aircraft are of the Sea-Bee type.

> Approved for both GI and CAA flight schools, flight and ground classes are held for private and commercial instruction. Munro has eight employees besides himself. All of them have pilot licences and three of the instructors hold commercial licenses.

> Before he took to flying himself, Munro had several years experience as an aircraft mechanic. He is a licensed land and sea pilot and has been designated as maintenance inspector by the CAA.

> Sale of Mobile products, which have been used since the first day of business, has risen in direct proportion to the rapid growth of the operation itself.
