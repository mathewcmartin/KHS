> Lieut. Comdr. T. L. Schwantes, Navy member of the Board, said operations from the Kenmore seaplane base would not interfere with the traffic pattern of Sand Point Naval Air Station. Schawantes said the military has no objection to the base.

> The King County Planning Commission will act on the rezoning of the area at its November 20 meeting. At the same time, the commission will act on a proposed seaplane-landplane base at Mercer Inlet, near the outlet of Coal Creek.

> The applicant for the Coal Creek base is Merrill W. Boyack, while a former naval officer, John F. Mines, has applied for the Kenmore designation. The property owner at Kenmore is Gus A. Newberg, and at Mercer Inlet, Loleta Havercamp, according to the planning commission.

> Before seaplane operations can commence, however, the applications of the two persons must be approved by the master Air Traffic Control Board in Washington, D.C., and by the County Planning Commission.

>At a Board of County Commissions' meeting last Monday, an airport committee was formed to report to the commissioners on an over-all airport-airplane plan for the future. The committee will report November 26.
