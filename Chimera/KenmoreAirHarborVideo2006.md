Caption Text:
> In 1946, Jack Mines, Reg Collins and Bob Munro leased an old shingle mill site on the north end of Lake Washington and started a base for seaplanes.

> Their first aircraft was a 36hp Aeronca K.

> Within six months Bob Munro was left with full responsibility for the endeavor.

> With high ethical standards, patience, courage, and tenacity, he guided the business for over 53 years.

> Today, Kenmore Air Harbor is the largest seaplane operation in the country.
