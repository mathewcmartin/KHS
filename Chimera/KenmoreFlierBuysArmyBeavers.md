# Kenmore flier buys Army Beavers

> Seattle appears to have cornered the market for Beavers, the flying kind.
  A dozen of the now-out-of-production single-engine airplanes were to arrive in containers this morning aboard the American Mail Lines' Hong Kong Mail at Pier 28.
  The planes, built between about 1952 and 1960, were purchased on a bid from the United States Army by the Kenmore Air Harbor, said Bob Munro, owner of the sea plane base at the north end of Lake Washington.
  The business already was flying five Beavers, Munro said, and decided to get some more. The planes were flown to Singapore from Vietnam for Seattle November 26.
  Eleven of the planes are olive drab, Munro said, but all had the words "U. S. Army" on the fuselage sloppily painted over with black paint so the Army would allow them to leave Singapore.
  "They're a real mess," Munro said, but when rebuilt will be sold for about $55,000 to $60,000 each.
  More than 1,500 Beavers were built by the De Havilland aircraft company in Canada, with 968 of them going to the United States Air Force and Army. The plane, first flown in 1947, has a 450-horsepower engine, holds seven people, and is popular with bush pilots.
