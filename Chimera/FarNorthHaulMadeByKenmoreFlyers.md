> A mining camp high on a Candanian Coast range glacier recently was completely outfitted in a unique airborne operation by Kenmore Air Harbor Planes.

> What made the operation so unusual was the "landing strip" of the float-equipped planes-- merely the snow covered surgace of the glacier itself.

> Ordinary land planes were out of the question because of the difficult location of the camp. Ski-equipped planes could not be used since there was no snow at Ketchikan from which to take off.

> So the Granby Mining Co., operators of the venture and one Canada's largest mining firms, called in the Kenmore Air Harbor people.

> A base camp was set up at the mouth of the Unuk river, some 80 miles from Ketchikan and about another 70 from the site of the mine at the Leduc glacier. Supplies were moved from Ketchikan to the Unuk river camp, and then flown up the river and across the Alaska-Canada boundary to the glacier.

> The float-equipped planes could take off quite readily at the mouth of the river and then could settle down into the soft snow at the glacier end of the trip.

> A complete mine actually was flown up, complete even to a small-scale railroad for the mine... engine, cars, tracks, etc. Also ferried in during the six-week operation were such varied items as dynamite, tents, washing machines and two diesel engines.

> Three planes were used, two Norsemen and a Seabee. Pilots were Bob Munro, operator of the Air Harbor and Bill Fisk and Paul Garner.

> They could fly only when the weather was good, usually only two or three days a week. The operation ceased, of necessity, when spring thaws began to crack the surface of the glacier. However, when the work began, there was at least 15 feet of snow around.

> The glacier landing field was at about 3,700 feet. The glacier is quite active, feeding both the Unuk and Leduc rivers.

> The men, plus a Canadian immigration inspector who had to check every load, lived the six weeks in their camp at the mouth of the Unuk. Ketchikan was the nearest town of any consequence.

> The Granby Co. is prospecting for copper in the area.

Three images of the Leduc glacier, the mining camp and the float planes involved were included with the article. With the accompanying caption:

> A complete mining camp was moved to the Canadian glacier shown in the above photos. Top picture is a staged picture according to pilot Bill Fisk, who took the pictures. Usually only one plane was on the glacier at a time. The second picture shows the many tracks left by the planes' floats on landing. The bottom shot is a portion of the miners' camp.
